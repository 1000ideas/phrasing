Example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule PhrasingHelper\r\n\r\n  def can_edit_phrases?\r\n    current_user.is_admin?\r\n  end\r\n  \r\nend\r\n```\r\nInclude the phrasing **html** initializer at the top of your body\r\n\r\n```haml\r\n= render 'phrasing/initializer'\r\n```\r\n\r\nInclude the required **javascript** file (most often in your application.js file):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//= require phrasing\r\n```\r\n\r\nInclude the required **stylesheet** file (most often in your application.css file):\r\n\r\n```css\r\n//= require phrasing\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use phrasing?\r\n\r\nStart with adding your phrases simply by writting in your view file:\r\n\r\n\t= phrase('my-first-phrase')\r\n\r\nApart from editing phrases (basically, Rails translations) you can also inline edit your models attributes, just use the same `phrase` method, with the first attribute being the record and the second one the records attribute:\r\n\r\n  \t= phrase(@post, :title)\r\n\r\nIn the above example, <tt>@post</tt> is the record with a <tt>title</tt> attribute.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nSince Phrasing can be used to update any attribute in any table (using the model_phrase method), special care must be taken into consideration from a security standpoint.\r\n\r\nBy default, Phrasing doesn't allow updating of any attribute apart from <<t>PhrasingPhrase.value</tt>. To be able to work with other attributes, you need to whitelist them.\r\n\r\nIn the <tt>config/initializers/phrasing.rb</tt> file you can whitelist your model attributes like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nPhrasing.white_list = [\"Post.title\", \"Post.body\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nor you can whitelist all of them (not recommended) with:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nPhrasing.allow_update_on_all_models_and_attributes = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrading from version 2.x to 3.x\r\n\r\nIn versions 3.0.0 and above we have added the Phrasing Versioning System which requires an additional table, so if you are upgrading to a 3.x release, run <tt>rake phrasing:install</tt> to get the additional migration file, <tt>rake db:migrate</tt> and thats it.\r\n\r\n## Turbolinks\r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing problems with Rails apps using Turbolinks, include the [jQuery-turbolinks](https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks) gem in your application and simply require it in the following order:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//= require jquery\r\n//= require jquery.turbolinks\r\n//= require phrasing\r\n//= require turbolinks\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Phrasing Appearance\r\n\r\nThe `phrase` view helper can take the `options` hash as the last parameter. Features:\r\n```ruby\r\nurl: custom_url # point Phrasing to other actions in other controllers\r\ninverse: true # change the hovered background and underline colors to better fit darker backgrounds\r\nclass: custom_class # add custom CSS classes to your phrases to change the appearance of phrases in your application \r\ninterpolation: { %min: 10 } # add variables to your translations just like w/ I18n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Infinum\r\n\r\nPhrasing relies heavily (or is built) on two other libraries: the [Copycat gem](https://github.com/Zorros/copycat) and the [ZenPen library](https://github.com/tholman/zenpen/tree/master/).
